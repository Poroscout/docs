**Need Help?**&#x20;

Join our [discord server](https://poroscout.derock.dev/discord) and ask in one of our public support channels, or make a ticket.
{% endhint %}

## Getting Started

To get started, invite the bot to your server by clicking [this](https://poroscout.derock.dev/invite) invite link and selecting the guild to add the bot to, then click **Continue**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Due to Discord limitations, at the time of writing, the **@everyone** role **must have** the `Use External Emojis`permission enabled or else the bot's response may look strange.

Slash commands [do not inherit](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/discussions/3307) the permissions of the bot, which is why you cannot give the bot the `Use External Emojis` permission and expect it to work.
{% endhint %}

Once the bot is in your guild, type `/` and a list of commands will pop up.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want users to be able to use this bot, make sure to allow them to use slash commands!
{% endhint %}
