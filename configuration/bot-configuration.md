# Bot Configuration

### Changing the prefix.

The bot uses discord's slash commands and does not support prefix changing. \
This feature is likely never going to be implemented since Discord [want's bots to use their slash command system](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404772028055-Message-Content-Privileged-Intent-for-Verified-Bots) rather than traditional prefixed commands.
