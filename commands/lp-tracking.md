# LP Tracking

PoroScout will automatically track the Rank, division, LP, and win/loss count of any linked account (`/link`). Every day at **Midnight UTC** the bot will update its data.

After linking your account, you will need to give PoroScout a few days to collect data as there is no way to get historical ranked info from Riot's API.&#x20;

### FAQ

**It just passed midnight, why is my graph not updated?**

Collecting data, while it is automated, still takes time. Please give the bot a few minutes to collect info and enter it into the database.

Graphs are also cached on the server and by Discord. You can bypass the Discord cache by clicking the graph and hitting **Open Original**. The PoroScout server also caches the image, and this cache you cannot bypass, so you will just have to wait, at max, an hour.

**How can I get my data removed?**

Please open a support ticket in our [discord server](https://poroscout.derock.dev/discord) and be ready to provide proof that you own the account of the data you want to be removed.&#x20;
